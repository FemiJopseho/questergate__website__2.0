I use to look for the "Holy grail" of tradiing. Many youtube videos are just lies. The training taught me how to create a tradining startegy and how to be disciplined. Now I can settle down and trade on my own.

The one-on-one training is expensive but I think it is the best.
I took the one-on-one training and it was worth it. Now I even teach others how to trade and I am a pro trader now.

It was not easy for me to keep up with the training due to my busy schedule. But with the class recording, I kept up. I have been making money from trading ever since.
